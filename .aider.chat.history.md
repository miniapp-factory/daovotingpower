Description:
DAO Voting Power Calculator helps users calculate their voting weight across different DAO governance systems. Understand how much influence your tokens provide and plan your governance participation effectively.

Key Features:
 • Calculates voting power based on token balance and DAO-specific rules.
 • Supports delegated voting, staked tokens, and veToken models.
 • Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.).
 • Comparison view for multiple DAOs.
 • Alerts for changes in governance parameters or voting multipliers.

Target Users:
DAO participants, governance voters, token holders, and analysts who want to understand and optimize their influence in decentralized governance.

Usage Instructions:
 1. Enter your wallet address or input token balances manually.
 2. Choose the DAO model (1 token = 1 vote, veToken, delegated voting, etc.).
 3. View your calculated voting power.
 4. Compare voting influence across multiple DAOs.

Benefits:
 • Understand your real governance power before voting.
 • Optimize your holdings for maximum voting impact.
 • Track changes in voting rules across DAOs.
